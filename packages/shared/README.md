## Shared Package

This package contains shared TypeScript utilities, domain models, and helpers
used across the Rayls AgroCredit / TerraRay apps and services.

- **Purpose**: central place for cross-cutting logic that is not specific to a single app.
- **Scope**: types, validation helpers, formatting utilities, API client helpers, and other shared code.

Code in this package should remain framework-agnostic and safe to use in both
backend and frontend contexts where appropriate.
