## Contracts Package

This package contains the on-chain smart contract code and related TypeScript types
for the Rayls TerraRay protocol.

- **Purpose**: shared contracts, ABIs, and generated types used by apps and other packages.
- **Scope**: core protocol contracts (e.g. `FarmerRegistry`, `FarmerNote`, `AgroVault`, `InvestorWhitelist`) and utilities.

Implementation details and architecture may evolve during the hackathon, but this
package is the single source of truth for protocol-level contracts.
